    Hi Scott.<br>
    We have a slow progress in developing. So I thought about that.<br>
    I think it's because of our communication.<br>
    We need to make fast communication via Skype.<br>
    Don't worry. Skype communication is only for fast development.<br>
    <span style="color: blue;">The other communication and payments will be done on the freelancer site.</span><br>
    Also, as you know, <span style="color: blue;"> we never mention about the other communication.</span><br>
    I will update you my working progress one by one on the Skype.
    If you agree with this, please add me here. <span style="color: red">live:.cid.58288b8bdc5be7f1</span><br>
    Thanks.
